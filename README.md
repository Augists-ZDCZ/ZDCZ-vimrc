# ZDCZ-vimrc

## Here is my **.vimrc**

I use **vim-plug** to manage my plugs of vim


==**MY SYSTEM**==

macOS Catalina 10.15.3


* Why I use **vim** as my Code Editor?

One day, I occasionally find an up **TheCW** in bilibili, whose videos greatly attract me.

I became to have a knowledge of the *new but old* editor, which comes with Unix but I never noticed that before. 

I really enjoy this code editor '**VIM**' cuz of its unrivaled & outstanding features. 


**GOD**
